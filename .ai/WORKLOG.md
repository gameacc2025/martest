## 2026-11-13 — SUPPORT-SLA-FALLBACK-AND-ACCEPTANCE

- **Code baseline:** `0d0a3866c6ff387978f8c5244f6ca936248f508d`.
- **CI:** [43474183592](https://github.com/gameacc2025/martest/actions/runs/43474183592) PASS — Frontend/Shared, Backend, Prisma and all three builds.
- **Migration:** [43474183157](https://github.com/gameacc2025/martest/actions/runs/43474183157) PASS — fresh PostgreSQL migration validation.
- **Runtime:** [43474183935](https://github.com/gameacc2025/martest/actions/runs/43474183935) PASS — Compose, health, migration status, seeds twice and 8/8 Playwright tests.
- **Support:** backend module, routes, service, API client and three-app workspace exist; browser test creates a ticket and posts a reply. SLA fallback for uncategorized tickets fixed; two unit tests cover fallback and category precedence.
- **Support remaining:** secure attachments, notification events, SLA calendar/worker/escalation, queue-level authorization and broader functional tests.
- **CRM remaining:** schemas/tests for non-lead route families, complete permission/tenant tests, conversion/merge idempotency and mutation E2E.
- **CMS/Recovery:** source and seeds exist; FAQ/Page CRUD acceptance and real SMS/reset E2E remain.
- **Local Windows/Docker/PostgreSQL:** NOT VERIFIED; no local destructive action taken.

## 2026-11-13 — CRM-LEAD-END-TO-END-ACCEPTANCE

- **Status:** CRM lead request/service/UI smoke acceptance PARTIAL and verified; broader CRM route coverage remains.
- **Request schemas:** Fastify schemas for lead create/update/assign/status/merge. Tests cover required fields, score bounds, ID format, assignment/status/merge contracts and permission denial.
- **Service tests:** lead normalization, score validation, active STAFF ownership, terminal lead protection and state-machine transitions.
- **UI bug fixed:** CRMWorkspace had unwrapped paginated API data into an array, then attempted to read `.data`, resulting in an empty Leads/Accounts view despite HTTP 200 and seeded rows. Added `unwrapPage` and applied it to lead/account lists.
- **Browser acceptance:** 8/8 Playwright tests PASS; STAFF login → PKCE handoff → CRM Leads; API returns seeded rows and the table is visible. Run `43463018256`.
- **CI:** run `43463018169` PASS — frozen install, Frontend/Shared tests, Prisma generation, Backend tests and all three builds.
- **Migration validation:** run `43463018358` PASS.
- **Code baseline:** `a281e3fb84978457e34d816b519ba2f664ea8caa`.
- **Docs:** backlog updated with CRM service/UI evidence; commit `db4d7dea29aa323c4061965e1b620b52f9960691`.
- **Still required for CRM:** schemas for remaining endpoint families, broader CRUD/service/permission/STAFF isolation, conversion/merge idempotency and create/update/assign/status Playwright journeys.
- **Other remaining:** Support vertical slice; CMS public/admin acceptance and real SMS delivery; generic SMS dispatcher; Audit event coverage; dashboard sample data; visual/accessibility regression.
- **Gated:** Retail/Finance activation requires explicit owner commercial/legal decisions.
- **Local state:** Windows working tree, stashes/untracked files, Docker and user PostgreSQL NOT VERIFIED; no local destructive action taken.
