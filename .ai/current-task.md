# Current Task — Full UI redesign using the four installed skills

**Status:** IN_PROGRESS — shared foundations, dashboards, public discovery and notification/settings surfaces updated; full 69-page redesign remains in progress.  
**Repository:** gameacc2025/martest  
**Branch:** main  
**Scope:** apps/website, apps/company, apps/admin, packages/shared-ui, design-system/, .ai/ and UI documentation.

## Product constraints
Preserve the Telecom Marketplace identity (Vazirmatn, Persian-first RTL, teal/navy/petrol palette, logo), Vue 3/JavaScript/PrimeVue 4 stack, APIs, routes, PKCE authentication, app-context/RBAC, tenant isolation, inquiry/RFQ rules, product lifecycle, notification behavior and commerce contracts. Do not add fake data or unsupported claims. No backend/schema/API/business-rule changes during this UI-only task.

## Required skill workflow
- UI UX Pro Max: accessibility, responsive layout, semantic tokens, form feedback and performance guidance.
- Taste Skill: product-specific composition; data-first app screens; avoid generic icon tiles, nested cards and decorative chrome.
- Impeccable: Operate mode for Admin/Company, Persuade for public discovery, Read for help/legal pages; preserve the established visual world.
- Vercel Web Interface Guidelines: semantic controls, keyboard/focus, image layout stability, reduced motion and robust states.

## Implemented slices
### Shared workspace foundation
- KpiCard uses typography-led real values without decorative icon tiles.
- DashboardPanel is a flat titled section.
- QuickActions is a compact navigation list.
- WorkspacePageHeading is task-first without eyebrow/icon decoration.
- PageHeader is a lightweight breadcrumb row, avoiding duplicate page titles.
- Focused component regression tests were added.

### Admin and Company dashboards/shell
- Simplified dashboard hero panels and removed decorative kickers/marks, gradients and shadows.
- Added accessible labels to icon-only product moderation actions.
- Updated shared topbar focus states, removed glass/shadow chrome, and made sidebar active state quieter with aria-current.
- Updated layout skip-target focus styling.

### Public marketplace
- Replaced homepage autoplay slideshow with a static search-first introduction.
- Converted homepage/catalogue product tiles and category tiles to semantic links/buttons.
- Updated public shell to use the shared BrandMark, removed unsupported footer marketing claims, corrected footer category links to use category IDs, and flattened sticky header chrome.
- Flattened Home, ProductListing, Categories and ProductDetails surfaces; removed fake zero counts and absent supplier placeholders; added image layout hints.

### Notifications and preferences
- All three inboxes now expose only the fixed INBOX and SAVED folders, in a stable order; custom/user-created folders are not shown.
- Kept All/Read/Unread filters and notification type categories.
- Preserved copy-to-SAVED and explicit move semantics, bulk delete/read-state actions and double-click-to-mark-read behavior.
- Website inbox rows now use semantic buttons rather than clickable divs.
- Reworked inbox and notification-preference surfaces to flat, readable tables/lists with responsive overflow and focus states.
- Added a shared fixed-folder normalizer and unit tests.

## Remaining phases
1. Admin and Company operational pages: products/forms, category and company management, users/roles/permissions, orders, reports, inquiry/RFQ detail/list/create/subscription flows.
2. Public Website: search results, company profiles, content/help/legal, profile, addresses, checkout/cart/order and inquiry pages.
3. Cross-app hardening: RTL/LTR isolation, dark/light themes, mobile/tablet layouts, keyboard/accessibility, loading/empty/error/disabled states and Vercel guideline review.
4. Full 69-page inventory and documentation update, then a truthful completion report.

## Verification
- Browser/screenshot inspection: NOT RUN — owner instruction.
- Automated tests/builds: NOT RUN — owner instruction. Regression tests are authored, not executed.
- Static review: ongoing. Do not claim runtime, visual or full redesign acceptance until all pages are reviewed and checks are authorized.

## Prior independent backlog
Company-owned API/tenant-isolation audit and SMS/provider integration remain separate. Do not silently mark them complete or change backend behavior during this UI-only task.


### Global shared component layer
- Added a cross-app skill refinement mixin to the shared Sass entry, emitted after legacy Sakai overrides.
- PrimeVue cards/panels, DataTables, toolbars, inputs and buttons now use flatter surfaces, consistent touch targets and explicit keyboard focus; dialog elevation is retained.
- Legacy stat and quick-action components are restyled data-first and as navigation rows.
- Static token-name review found no undefined semantic token references in the new mixin. Sass compilation was not run.


### Forms, tables and inquiry workflows
- Shared FormSectionHeader and RequiredFieldsProgress are now typography-first and free of decorative icon/kicker treatment.
- Shared DataTable has semantic loading/empty states, aria-busy, quieter mobile rows and consistent focus/touch targets.
- Product form/list and inquiry/RFQ page families receive cross-app flat-surface refinements.
- Website inquiry subscription now uses the shared page heading and accessible quota progress meters.
- New component regression tests are authored; execution remains NOT RUN by owner instruction.
